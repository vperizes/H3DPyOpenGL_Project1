# H3DPyOpenGL_Project1
This is the first project/tutorials from the course "Learn OpenGL with Python for Graphics and Games" from Hollistic 3D. The python scripts in this project define basic point drawing functions using the openGL library/package. These scripts are used to better understand the basics of openGL program structures: 
- Setting up window pixel size and camera rendering scale
- Creating a main loop (get inputs, clear screen, set colors, draw objects, swap buffers)
- Quit window
